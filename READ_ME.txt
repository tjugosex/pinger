Modified from another project to be used with gmail.
EmailAddresses.txt is where you put the recievers mail
IpAddresses.txt is the ips you want to ping
Name.txt is the name of those addresses in the same order
The only thing that needs to be modified other than that are EMAIL and APP_PASSWORD in PingTest.py which you get from gmail.
